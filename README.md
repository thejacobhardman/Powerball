# Powerball

This is a program that lets the user play a guessing game based on a simplified version of the US Lottery.

The user has the option to either pick their numbers manually or have the computer pick random numbers.

Here is a breakdown of the player's winnings based on how many numbers they guessed correctly.

For the purposes of this program, the powerball does not count as a correct guess; however, guessing the powerball correctly will increase your winnings.

Numbers Correct	Powerball	Winnings
        1	       No	     $1.00
        1	       Yes	     $2.00
        2	       No	     $10.00
        2	       Yes	     $20.00
        3	       No	     $100.00
        3	       Yes	     $1000.00

The program will allow the player to continue playing until they decide to close the program.
